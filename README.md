## Reinventing Bitcoin
Welcome to CRYPT! We think it is time to face Bitcoin's biggest problem and start making Bitcoin usable by everyone and not only nerds and enthusiasts like us. We want Bitcoin to be as easy as swiping a credit card while also offering all other benefits of Bitcoin. If you want to be part of this journey please check out our [wiki](https://github.com/m4r1vs/CRYPT/wiki) where we describe how we want to make Bitcoin the worlds number one currency used by billions of people around the planet!
## Ideas
Currently CRYPT is nothing more than a bunch of ideas and concepts. I haven't written any actual code yet. One idea mentioned by reddit user [/u/Beastly_Beast](https://www.reddit.com/user/Beastly_Beast) is to have two seperate accounts in the wallet. One called "Savings" and one "Cash". The savings-wallet would be a plain old bitcoin wallet and the cash-wallet would consist of one or more lightning channels. The goal is to automate the creation and closing process of these channels so that the user doesn't have to worry about it. All he has to know is that when he wants to buy stuff he should use his cash-wallet because the transactions happen almost instantanous and without real fees.
Maybe even make it an option to autofill the cash account so the user won't ever run into the problem of not having enough money in the cash account.

Categories is another thing I haven't seen in many bitcoin wallets yet. The user would be able to assign categories to his spendings to keep track of how much he spends on what. This would also be a great usecase for some AI-magic which assigns categories automatically based on given descriptions. The [Wallet](https://budgetbakers.com) app (has nothing to do with bitcoins, just an app to keep track of expenses) is a great example for this.

I also want to keep the user from seeing any technical information about the transactions. In many wallets there are buttons to "see transaction on blockchain.info", etc., but in my opinion this just scares people who have no idea and do not want to learn about it. The most technical thing that the user has to know about is his bitcoin adress. But this would be introduced to him in a way everyone would understand it. Maybe allow the user to enable an "extended mode" in the settings so some information will be displayed then.
