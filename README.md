## Inspiration üéâ
Every bitcoin wallet is usable. But only for Nerds and enthusiasts like us. It is time to change that. CRYPT is the first bitcoin wallet which has all the bells and whistles like support for the lightning network but doesn't require any knowledge and is as easy to use as just swiping a credit card while ensuring first-class-privacy and all other benefits of bitcoin!
